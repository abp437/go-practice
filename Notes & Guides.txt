Guides:

A lot of learning Go is about learning about the standard library packages and how they work.
It's also about navigating through the official documentation.
Go's error messages in Code Editor and Compiler are very efficient and informative. Try to infer from it before Googling about it.

Notes:
Structs in Go are just like Objects in JavaScript. You can attach methods to it and store values of different data types in one container.
Interfaces are functions which can be applied across multiple different Structs. They can thus accept values of different data types in it. Provided that the Struct implements all the functions mentioned in the interface.
