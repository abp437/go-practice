I am thinking that I should follow idiomatic way of writing Go code via the usage of Effective Go:
https://golang.org/doc/effective_go

I am going to follow "The Net Ninja" Golang series for the language fundamentals

100 Days of Code:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-code-a-complete-guide-for-beginners-and-experienced/
I am following the 100 days of code beginner model for Learning Golang, DS and Algos and Problem Solving in general.
My 100 days will end on 26th September 2021.

Day 1 (18 June 2021):
Language Introduction
Format Specifiers
List Types - Arrays and Slices

Day 2 (19 June 2021):
Functions with Closures - Higher Order functions
Loops

I think I could have achieved more today. Today's day was a bust.
If I continue at this pace, my 100 days would be futile especially if I am at such a pace during weekend.
I expected to be more speedy during the weekend.
I'll improve it by being more targeted.

Day 3 (20 June 2021):
Functions with Multiple return values
Functions and Variables with global scope in Package
Maps - Associative arrays

I felt terrible about today again, since my time was wasted in other things.

Day 4 (21 June 2021):
Pass by Value and Pass by Reference Types
Pointers
Structs

I feel good today overall, since my topics covered today were good, also I bought a new phone for my sister today.

Day 5 (22 June 2021):
Struct Methods(Receiver Functions)
Pointer Receiver Functions
